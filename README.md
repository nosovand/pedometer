This project aims to create a pedometer program for collecting noise/step data and training a machine learning model to detect steps accurately. The data collection program is called "collectData.py" and allows users to collect noise/step data by selecting the number of sequences to be recorded. The main pedometer program is called "pedometer.py". It works by filtering the values of acceleration data obtained from the serial port and applying a simple algorithm based on the square of sensor acceleration to detect steps, which are then verified using the machine learning model created using the data collected by "collectData.py". The model training program is called "learnData.py" and uses machine learning classifiers, such as neural networks and random forests, to classify the collected data.
